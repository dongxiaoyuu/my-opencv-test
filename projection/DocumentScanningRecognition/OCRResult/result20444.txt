On fine rp we manipulate the top deft pach in Vive an

In RGB format, we would have a value obs for ned, % for
green, and 256 tor blue. thus making, ita pure Dhue cobor

However, as | mentioned above, We need Eo take special

We actually read this pixel as 255 for red, G for green, and
O tor blue, making it a red color, uefa blue color

Atter setting the top lett pixel to have a red color on Line
1g, we then grab the pixel value and print it back to con:
sole on Lines 15 and 76, just to demonstrate that we have
indeed successfully changed the color of the pixel

Accessing and setting a single pixel value is simple enous,
but what if we wanted to use NumPw’s array shomy capa
bilities to access larger rectangular portions of the image?
Phe code below demonstrates how we can do this:

In fact, this is the top-left corner of the image! In order to
